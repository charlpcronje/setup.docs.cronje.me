dutree â€“ A CLI Tool to Analyze Disk Usage in Coloured Output

`dutree` is a free open-source, fast command-line tool for analyzing disk usage, written in Rust programming language. It is developed from durep (disk usage reporter) and tree (list directory content in tree-like format) command line tools. dutree therefore reports disk usage in a tree-like format.

It displays `coloured` output, depending on values configured in the GNU `LS_COLORS` environment variable. This `env` variable enables for setting the colours of files based on extension, permissions as well as file type.

## dutree Features:

- Show the file system tree.
- Supports aggregating of small files.
- Allows for comparing different directories.
- Supports excluding of files or directories.

## How to Install dutree in Linux Systems

To install **dutree** in Linux distributions, you must have rust programming language installed on your system as shown.


```sh
sudo curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

Once rust installed, you can run the following command to install strong>dutree in Linux distributions as shown.

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/nachoparker/dutree.git
```

After installing dutree, it uses environment colors according to the variable LS_COLORS, it has the same colors `ls --color` command that our distro has configured.

```sh
ls --color
```

The simplest way of running dutree is without arguments, this way it shows a filesystem tree.

```sh
dutree
```

To display real disk usage instead of file size, use the `-u` flag.

```sh
dutree -u
```

### Show Directories in Depth

You can show directories up to a given **depth** (default **1**), using the **-d** flag. The command below will show directories up to a depth of 3, under the current working directory.

For example if the current working directory `(~/)`, then display size of `~/*/*/*` as shown in the following sample screenshot.

```sh
dutree -d 3
```

### Exclude Files or Directories in Output

To exclude matching a file or directory name, use the `-x` flag.

```sh
dutree -x CentOS-7.0-1406-x86_64-DVD.iso
```

You can also get a quick local overview by skipping directories, using the `-f` option, like so.

```sh
dutree -f
```

A full summary/overview can be generated using the `-s` flag as shown.

```sh
dutree -s
```

### ggregate Small Files

It is possible to aggregate files smaller than a certain size, default is 1M as shown.

```sh
dutree -a
```

### Exclude Hidden Files

The `-H` switch allows for excluding hidden files in the output.

```sh
dutree -H
```

The `-b` option is used to print sizes in bytes, instead of kilobytes (default).

```sh
dutree -b
```

To turn off colors, and only display `ASCII` characters, use the `-A` flag like so.

```sh
dutree -A
```

You can view the dutree help message using the `-h` option.

```sh
dutree -h

Usage: dutree [options]  [..]
 
Options:
    -d, --depth [DEPTH] show directories up to depth N (def 1)
    -a, --aggr [N[KMG]] aggregate smaller than N B/KiB/MiB/GiB (def 1M)
    -s, --summary       equivalent to -da, or -d1 -a1M
    -u, --usage         report real disk usage instead of file size
    -b, --bytes         print sizes in bytes
    -x, --exclude NAME  exclude matching files or directories
    -H, --no-hidden     exclude hidden files
    -A, --ascii         ASCII characters only, no colors
    -h, --help          show help
    -v, --version       print version number
```
