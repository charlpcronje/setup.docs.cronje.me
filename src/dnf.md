DNF stands for Dandified yum. DNF is a software package manager for RPM-based Linux distributions such as Fedora, RHEL and CentOS. It is the next upcoming major version of Yum. DNF is first introduced in Fedora and has replaced to become the default package manager of the Fedora distributions. DNF is same as Yum that installs, updates and removes packages on RPM bas4ed Linux systems. DNF is introduced for improving the bottlenecks of Yum such as performance, Memory usages, Dependency resolution, speed, and some other factors. The latest stable release of DNF is 1.0 and it is written in Python.

To install DNF on RHEL/CentOS 7 systems, you need to set up and enable epel YUM REPO before installing DNF.

## Install EPEL

```shell
yum install epel-release
```

## Install DNF

```shell
yum install dnf
```

## Using DNF

You can now start to run commands using DNF. To view the man page you can use the following command:

```shell
dnf â€“help
```

## DNF vs YUM command Examples

1. Install a Package

```shell
YUM: yum install <package>
```

Eg: yum install httpd

```shell
DNF: dnf install <package>
```

```shell
Eg: dnf install httpd
```

## Upgrade a package

```shell
YUM: yum upgrade <package>
```

```shell
Eg: yum update mysql-server
```

```shell
DNF: dnf upgrade <package>
```

```shell
Eg: dnf upgrade mysql-server
```

## Remove a package

```shell
YUM: yum remove <package>
```

Eg: yum remove httpd

```shell
DNF: dnf remove <package>
```

```shell
Eg: dnf remove httpd
```
