# VS Code Server Extensions

The following extensions are what I use at the moment, depending in different projects I would install or uninstall some of these, so I'm making two lists. The 1st list is what I always use and then I made some additional lists depending on the technology I'm using. I'm also added the font I'm using and how to add it so VS Code

## Preferred font

[Download](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Code)

`Fira Code`, it supports font-ligatures [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aI4l2sSwV0)

### Add to VS Code

To open the settings editor: from the Code menu, choose `Preferences` > `Settings`, or use keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+`

To enable `FiraCode` in the settings editor: under `Commonly Used`, expand the `Text Editor` settings and then click on `Font`. In the `Font Family` input box type `Fira Code`, replacing any content. Tick the check box `Enables/Disables font ligatures` under `Font Ligatures` to enable the special ligatures.

## When working with Node / NPM / Yarn / PNPM / XPM

These days you can hardly avoid using NPM or some Node Package Manager, I like to use NPM for all global Packages and Yarn for LocalPackages, this way there are no conflicts and because Yarn is faster than NPM I use Yarn for local packages because I use it more often
